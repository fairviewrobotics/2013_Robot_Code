Hello Everyone! 
Welcome to FRC 2013 for Fairview High School!

An AWESOME (free) tutorial for git! Learn it!
http://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-git

We use this breaching model! This is your Git bible
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/

RULES:
1) The MASTER branch is PROTECTED! This means you can not commit to master. 
	(See Procedure #2 on how to get your code approved into master.)
	The reason for this is so that we can keep the master bug free and clean. 

2) Work on the development branch or feature branch. Try to follow the rules outlined at:
http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/
(quick guide included in root of repo as Git-branching-model.pdf)


PROCEDURE:
0.5) Checking out the repo… well, if you're here… good job :P

1) Starting a new feature branch
	1.A) run the command "git checkout -b myfeature develop"

	See ( http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/ ) for info
	This makes you a new branch off of the develop branch,
	here you can feel free to work on your new feature without fear of merge Errors! (ewww)
	
2) Finishing a feature branch (merging it into develop)
	2.A) git checkout develop
	2.B) git merge --no-ff myfeature
	2.C) OPTIONAL  git branch -d myfeature 
	2.D) git push origin develop

3) Getting Code Approved To Master Branch
	3.A) In the top bar of the repo, select "Merge Requests"
	3.B) Select "New Merge Request" button
	3.C) In "From" section select the branch you wish to get approved.
	3.D) In "To" section select "Master"
	3.E) Under "Title" type an short description of what your code changes
	3.F) Under "Assign to" Select "Alex Mault" (or other mentor)
	3.G) Select "Save"

	What NOT to do… DO NOT merge your branch into master on your computer.
	The server WILL reject any attempt to push to master.
